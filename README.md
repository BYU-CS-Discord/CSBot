## Usage or Development

### Prerequisites

This project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.10 or later), [NPM](https://npmjs.org/). To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command:

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
7.20.3
v16.15.1
```

### Clone the Repo

```sh
$ cd path/to/parent
$ git clone https://github.com/BYU-CS-Discord/CSBot.git
$ cd CSBot
```

### Get your own bot token

Note that, by running this bot, you agree to be bound by the Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383) and [Developer Policy](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8563934450327), as well as [this project's own license](/LICENSE). With that in mind, you'll need a token for a Discord bot account. See [this awesome tutorial on how to get one](https://www.howtogeek.com/364225/how-to-make-your-own-discord-bot/).

### Configure the bot

Create a file called `.env` in the root of this project folder. Paste your token into that file, and fill in other config items as desired:

```sh
# .env

DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
# required, token for your Discord bot
```

**Do not commit this file to git** or your bot _will_ get "hacked".

### Invite your bot to your server

Go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#378091424832 and paste in your bot's client ID to get an invite link.

### Important Note for Windows Users

If you're on Windows, `npm` scripts will not work unless you tell `npm` to use Git Bash as its default shell when running commands.

Before continuing, run this command:

```sh
$ npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```

You must have [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed. See this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46006249) for more details.

### Build the bot server

Be sure to install dependencies, and run a quick lint to generate needed files:

```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run lint
```

The first time you download the source, and each time the source code changes, you'll need to run this command before you run the bot:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Register Slash Commands

If you want support for Discord [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ), you'll need to deploy the commands directly. To avoid rate limits, use a command-line tool, rather than deploying on startup.

Once you have your bot's account token in the .env file, run the following command to tell Discord about our commands:

```sh
$ npm run commands:deploy
```

### Run the bot

Since this bot is just a Node script, any Node process manager will do.

```sh
$ node .
# or
$ npm start
# or
$ pm2 start .
```

## Commands
