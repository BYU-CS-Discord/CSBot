## Chat Input Commands

You can find these in Discord by typing `/` in the message input box in any channel where you're allowed to run commands.

### /emoji

Retrieves the internal picture for a custom emoji. By default responds ephemerally but when provided with a `false` boolean it responds so everyone can see the returned picture.

### /findroom ( now / at / between / when )

Searches for open rooms on BYU Campus. _'Now'_, _'At'_, and _'Between'_ allow you to filter your search by time. \_'When'\_ allows you to see when a specified room is available.

### /help

Prints some info about the bot, including the current running version and a link to the code repository.

### /iscasdown

Checks whether BYU's CAS system is operational, because it crashes fairly often.

### /profile

Retrieves the profile picture of the given user.

### /sendtag

Not complete. For now, this command simply auto-completes the tag the user types, but it does not send the tag.

### /stats ( track / update / list / leaderboard / untrack )

Tracks a statistic for the issuer. Use the `track` subcommand to begin tracking, `update` to add or subtract to it, `list` to show all the stats being tracked for the issuer, `leaderboard` to show the users with the highest scores for a stat, and `untrack` to stop tracking a stat for you.

### /talk

Uses the [dectalk](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts) text-to-speech engine to speak the message you give it, either sending a .wav file in a text channel or talking out loud in a voice channel. Comes with 9 different voices.

By using this command, you are acknowleding that your input will be sent to a third-party web API, which may use your information however it wants. Please see [this disclaimer](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts#about).

### /tothegallows

Begins a new game of Evil Hangman.

### /xkcd

Retrieves the most recent [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic, or the given one.

## Context Menu Commands

You can find these in Discord by invoking the context menu (right-clicking) on any message in any channel where you're allowed to run commands.

### Alt Text

Prints the alt text attached to any images included in the message you use it on.

### Fix Twitter/X Links

Transforms [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) and [x.com](https://x.com/) links in the given message to [FxTweet/FixupX](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter) links in an ephemeral reply. Please use fxtwitter/fixupx in your own messages, especially when the tweet is a video. The default embed stinks on some platforms.

### Talk

Performs the same function as the `/talk` chat input command, but uses the selected message as input.
Can be used to repeat the same 'talk' command without typing it out again.

## Usage or Development

If you've read this far, and don't plan to run or develop on the bot yourself, or are not curious how to do so, you may leave now. This part is quite boring. But feel free to read on anyway!

### Prerequisites

This project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.17 or later) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/). To make sure you have them available on your machine, try running the following command:

```sh
$ node -v && npm -v
v18.17.1
9.6.7
```

If you don't want to install Node or any other dependencies on your machine, you may also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker runs the project in a lightweight virtual Linux environment will all dependencies pre-installed, so functionality will be identical on any operating system.

All Docker management (like building, running, and cleaning up images and containers) has been automated, so you only have to follow a few simple steps.

You can install Docker from their website linked above. To make sure Docker is available on your machine, run the following command:

```sh
$ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.22, build 3a2c30b
```

### Clone the Repo

```sh
$ cd path/to/parent
$ git clone https://github.com/BYU-CS-Discord/CSBot.git
$ cd CSBot
```

### Get your own bot token

Note that, by running this bot, you agree to be bound by the Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383) and [Developer Policy](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8563934450327), as well as [this project's own license](/LICENSE). With that in mind, you'll need a token for a Discord bot account. See [this awesome tutorial on how to get one](https://www.howtogeek.com/364225/how-to-make-your-own-discord-bot/).

### Configure the bot

Create a file called `.env` in the root of this project folder. Paste your token into that file, and fill in other config items as desired:

```sh
# .env

DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
# Required, token for your Discord bot

DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL_GOES_HERE
# Required for any DB functionality, we will get this URL in a later section
```

**Do not commit this file to git** or your bot _will_ get "hacked".

### Invite your bot to your server

Go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#378091424832 and paste in your bot's client ID to get an invite link.

### Setting up Docker

> **Highly Recommended!**
>
> If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can use the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension, which will run the whole project in the Docker container. If you choose to do so, you can ignore every Docker instruction after this. Very nifty!

If you wish to run the project in Docker, use the following command before continuing:

```sh
$ npm run docker
```

This will build a simple Linux image, start a container of that image, and then mount the project folder into the container.

Once the container is started, you will see your command prompt change. You are now in a virtual Linux environment. If you run `ls`, you will see all the project files. Any changes you make to these files are synced between your local computer and the container.

Now that your command line is in the Docker container, you can run any part of the project and develop without worrying about compatibility.

To close the container, simply run `exit`. To start a new container, use `npm run docker` again. Every time you open the project, you should start a container before developing.

The docker script will take care of every part of the docker development process, including building, running, and cleaning up, so you only need to worry about a single command.

### Build the bot

Be sure to install dependencies, run a quick lint to generate needed files, compile the source, and deploy commands. Here's a handy command to do all of that:

```sh
$ npm run setup
```

### Build the bot database

_As we use Prisma for managing our database, it is up to you what relational database framework to use._

By default, CSBot uses SQLite. All persistent data is stored in a single file.

First decide where you want your database file to go, then edit this line in your `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=file:/path/to/your/database.db
```

The first time you run this project, you should run the following command to initialize the database at the configured path:

```
$ npm run db:init
```

Migrations can be run on the database with the following command:

```
$ npm run db:migrate
```

### Register Slash Commands

If you want support for Discord [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ), you'll need to deploy the commands directly. To avoid rate limits, use a command-line tool, rather than deploying on startup.

Once you have your bot's account token in the .env file, run the following command to tell Discord about our commands:

```sh
$ npm run commands:deploy
```

### Test the bot

Whenever you make changes, you should make sure to run all unit tests before submitting.

```sh
$ npm run test
```

If you have added new code, you should write new unit tests to cover all the code you've written. Our goal is 100% code coverage.

### Run the bot

For development purposes:

```sh
$ node .
# or
$ npm run dev
```

For production purposes (this will spawn a separate thread using [PM2](https://pm2.io/) that will run in the background):

```sh
$ npm start
$ npm run stop
$ npm run restart
```
