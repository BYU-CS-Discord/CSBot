## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if we merge a pull request, we look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent?

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that.

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells us the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows us
the action you have taken to solve it.
